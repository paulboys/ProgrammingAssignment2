# This is a function to calculate the inverse of a matrix: the funciton checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated and cached. If so it retrieves the inverse from the cache. Otherwise it calculates the inverse.

## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a list:
1)sets the value of the matrix
2)gets the value of the matrix
3)sets the value of the inverse
4)gets the value of the inverse

## The cacheSolve function computes the inverse of  matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix; if the inverse has been calcualted already, cacheSolve retrieves the inverse from the cache
